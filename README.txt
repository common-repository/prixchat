## Frequently Asked Questions
**What makes PrixChat specials?**
There are dozens of stuffs that makes PrixChat different with other plugins, but at its core, PrixChat uses Server Sent Events which is fast, no complicated setup like others which built on top of long-polling or WebSocket server. The frontend also uses React.js which WordPress already heavy using it. 

**Is there any external service or account required?**
In short, No.
We are working hard to release Audio and Video call features; a signal server is probably required but only for those enhanced features. All of core features stays free forever. 

**Is SSE a proven technology?**
The SSE keyword maybe new to you but if you know Firebase is built with it for their famous real time database product, you’ll love it. 
Our story: PrixChat was battle tested for two years before release, we’re using it for internal communicate without email, the product started from using Firebase and then shifted to our own hosted solution, the transition was smooth.

**When is new update rolled?**
We believe constant update is the key of a healthy software but we also don't want to annoy people with meaningless updates.
The feature updates releases monthly, every first Tuesday.
If we found a serious bug, the minor patch will come within 24 hours.
